### 2.1.1. Description
Speaking with Bushy Evergreen:
	Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U! I'm glad you're here. I'm the target of a terrible trick. Pepper Minstix is at it again, sticking me in a text editor. Pepper is forcing me to learn ed. Even the hint is ugly. Why can't I just use Gedit? Please help me just quit the grinchy thing.

Oh, many UNIX tools grow old, but this one's showing gray.
That Pepper LOLs and rolls her eyes, sends mocking looks my way.
I need to exit, run - get out! - and celebrate the yule.
Your challenge is to help this elf escape this blasted tool.

You did it! Congratulations!

### 2.1.3. Afterwords
Speaking again with Bushy Evergreen:
	Hi, I'm Bushy Evergreen. Welcome to Elf U! Wow, that was much easier than I'd thought. Maybe I don't need a clunky GUI after all! Have you taken a look at the password spray attack artifacts? I'll bet that DeepBlueCLI tool is helpful. You can check it out on GitHub. It was written by that Eric Conrad. He lives in Maine - not too far from here!
