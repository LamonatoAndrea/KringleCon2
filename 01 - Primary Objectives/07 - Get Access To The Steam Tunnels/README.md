# 1. Primary Objectives
## 1.7. Get Access To The Steam Tunnels
### 1.7.1. Description
Gain access to the steam tunnels. Who took the turtle doves? Please tell us their first and last name. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Minty's dorm room and talk with Minty Candy Cane.
### 1.7.2. Solution
From the chat I saw people speaking about Krampus holding a key, therefore I searched for him and downloaded its png from the network traffic.

At this point I downloaded below key samples to create an outline of depths from 0 to 9:
* 012012
* 345345
* 678678
* 900009

By overlapping the depths outline I obtained from samples with the key held by Krampus, I identified the key to be 122520.

Once in the steam tunnel Krampus tells his last name and that he borrowed Santa’s turtle doves.
### 1.7.3. Flag
The flag is: ​**Krampus Hollyfeld​**.
